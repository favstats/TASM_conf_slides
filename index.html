## Research so far

### and linking filter bubbles to extremism

### Research so far

The empirical evidence of a "filter bubble" effect is less clear and decidedly less pessimistic. 

+ Findings from a study on Facebook suggest filter bubbles are generated less by algorithms than by individual user decisions (Bakshy, Messing and Adamic, 2015). 

+ Research analysing Google news recommendation suggests essential information is not omitted (Haim, Graefe and Brosius, 2018) 

+ Personalised recommendations show no reduction in diversity over human editors (Möller et al., 2018). 

+ Finally, research on Google search results also finds factors such as time of search were more explanatory than prior behaviour and preferences (Courtois, Slechten and Coenen, 2018).

Why the discrepancy?

+ "Echo chamber about echo chambers" (Guess et al. 2018)

### Filter Bubbles and Extremism

There is a paucity of research studying the effects of personalisation algorithms on extremist content.

.eightyseven[

&lt;br&gt;

+ YouTube's recommended videos can propel users into an immersive bubble of right-wing extremism (O’Callaghan et al., 2015)

+ Twitter’s “Who to Follow” suggested violent extremist Islamist groups if the user followed al-Qaeda affiliated group (Berger, 2013)

+ Facebook’s “Recommended Friends” function had likely actively connected at least two Islamic State supporters in SE Asia (Waters and Postings, 2018)

]

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

The architecture of the platforms may facilitate closer interactions than would otherwise exist.

### Research Design &amp; Results 

&gt; Do algorithms promote extremist material once a user begins to interact with such content?


&lt;img src="images/social_media_logos.png" width="1121" /&gt;

**How to measure extremist content?**

--

+ Hand-coding content with Holbrook's Extremist Media Index

Holbrook's Extremism Media Index (2015)

&lt;img src="images/holbrooke_index.png" width="1280" /&gt;

### Expected Relationships

+ Frequency of extreme material increases after interacting with extreme content

+ Extreme content is prioritized by the algorithm when interacting with extreme material

**Methods**

+ Count data modeled with (quasi-)poisson regression

+ Non-Parametric t-tests to estimate ranking differences

&lt;br&gt;


+ YouTube Experimental design 
    + Created **THREE** identical accounts
    + All follow same 10 XRW accounts; 10 Neutral
    + Each account interacts with different kinds of content

1. *Neutral Interaction Accounts* interact with neutral content 
2. *Extreme Interaction Accounts* interact with extreme content 
3. *Baseline Accounts* do nothing to establish a baseline

+ Pull 18 Recommended  Videos of each account **two times a day** for *two weeks*.

+ Every piece of content gets a unique rank per session and an Extremist Media Index (EMI) Score (Holbrook, 2015)

+ Satisfactory interrater reliability between two individuals  (Krippendorff's alpha: 0.77)

### Selective Exposure

This means that people tend to 

+ select content (selective exposure),
+ interpret it (selective perception) and 
+ later better remember the information (selective retention) 

that is in line with their already existing ideas (cf. Zillmann and Bryant 1985)

### What are Personalisation Algorithms?

.pull-left[
![](images/pariser.jpg)
&lt;br&gt;Pariser 2011
]


+ Algorithms are responsible for content that users see in their feeds 

+ Eli Pariser suggests that they can create a “filter bubble” effect or “autopropaganda”

+ by controlling what users do and do not see it can – and is in fact, designed to – dramatically amplify confirmation bias

+ The pre-filtering of content leads to bubbles in which people never view or read about opposing viewpoints

+ Creates seperated spaces that make communication between opposing viewpoints harder: undermines democracy itself


---


### What are Personalisation Algorithms?

&lt;br&gt;

The EU Group on Media Freedom and Pluralism notes that: 

&gt; Increasing filtering mechanisms makes it more likely for people to only get news on subjects they are interested in, and with the perspective they identify with. It will also tend to create more insulated communities as isolated subsets within the overall public sphere. [...] Such developments undoubtedly have a potentially negative impact on democracy.

*Vīķe-Freiberga, Däubler-Gmelin, Hammersley, &amp; Pessoa Maduro, 2013, p. 27*

&lt;br&gt;

**Filter bubbles are considered a concern at the highest level.**

### How to measure extremist content?

Multiple pathways:

+ Sentiment analysis can be used to identify extremist authors (Scrivens et al., 2018)

+ Topic models to identify (far-right) extremist content (O’Callaghan et al., 2015)

+ Hand-coding content for example with Holbrook's Extremist Media Index (Holbrook, 2015)

+ Manually labelled data can also be used as training dataset for machine learning models
